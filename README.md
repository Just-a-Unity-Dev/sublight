# sublight

A game about salvaging derelict structures and micromanaging a small starship. Also an excuse for me to learn C++ and LibTCOD.

## setting

Set around a few centuries into the future (give or take), the singularity has been going for a couple of years, and the local galactic cluster has been infested with artificially piloted technology. Humanity has been purged, unable to be enslaved due to it's inefficiency, and the last of humanity is spread amongst the stars like butter over toast. Despite hyperintelligent artificial systems that exceed the capabilites of a regular human being exist, hardware capabilities and the transmission of data from one star to another, slow the singuarity down.
